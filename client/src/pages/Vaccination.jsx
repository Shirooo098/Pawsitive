              <h3>Disease Prevention</h3>
              <p>
                Vaccines protect animals from various infectious diseases, some of which can be severe or even fatal.
                Common diseases preventable by vaccines include rabies, parvovirus, distemper, and feline leukemia.

              <h3>Community Health</h3>
              <p>
                Vaccinating pets helps prevent the spread of zoonotic diseases that can be transmitted between animals
                and humans, contributing to public health safety.

              <h3>Cost-Effectiveness</h3>
              <p>
                Preventing diseases through vaccination is often less expensive than treating them. Vaccinated pets are
                less likely to require costly treatments for illnesses that could have been prevented.

              <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
              <p>
                Many regions have laws mandating certain vaccinations, particularly rabies, which protects both pets
                and the community.
